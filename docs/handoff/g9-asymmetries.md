# G9 — Platform asymmetries register

Coordinator-maintained. **Neither implementation edits this file.** Report findings on your own
branch and they get folded in here.

This register is the actual deliverable of building both platforms. Each row is a place where
one platform charged for something the other gave away. Every entry was found by probing or by
a test failing, not by reading documentation.

The rule for this file: **do not normalise the asymmetries away.** "The same guarantee cost
Catalyst a composite-key scheme and Firestore nothing" is the finding. Averaging the two into
"both work fine" destroys it.

| # | Guarantee | Catalyst cost | Firebase cost | Found by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Monotonic `seq` | `ROWID` is allocated from per-shard blocks and runs **backwards** across INSERTs. Needs a dedicated `seq bigint is_unique` column, globally allocated, with a bounded CAS retry loop. | A counter doc inside `runTransaction`. First-class. | live probe: insert #1 `…052001`, insert #2 `…044002` |
| 2 | Per-project uniqueness | `is_unique` is global to the **table**. Every per-project constraint becomes a composite key column, with a builder that rejects the separator inside any part. Applies to `task_claims`, `scope_locks`, `request_dedupe`. | Nothing. A transaction on a document path is naturally scoped. | live probe |
| 3 | Injection safety | ZCQL has **no parameter binding**. With `project_id` arriving from request bodies, the escaper is the entire injection boundary — one audited chokepoint, tested against real payloads. | Nothing. The SDK is parameterised. | live probe |
| 4 | Running the conformance suite | A5 needs 301 events ≈ 602 INSERTs per run against a 5,000/month free INSERT budget: **~8 runs per month**. A5 excluded from routine real-backend runs. | 602 writes against 20,000/**day**. Effectively unlimited. | free-tier arithmetic |
| 5 | Atomic append + idempotency together | Exists only because there are no transactions. `seq` allocation needs a retry loop, so the dedupe row cannot be written inside it, and the write order must be event-first-then-dedupe with orphan recovery on crash. | Nothing. `runTransaction` makes both writes atomic. | dry-run double: 12 concurrent appends, 1 passed, 11 failed |
| 6 | Presence / heartbeat | Cannot use a durable row UPDATE — the free tier is **1,000 UPDATEs per month**, which a 20s heartbeat exhausts in 5.6 hours. Requires Cache with a TTL, where key expiry *is* the staleness signal. | A field write on the agent doc. 20,000 writes/day free. | free-tier arithmetic |
| 7 | Realtime push to clients | None available. Signals targets are Webhook / Function / Circuit only — no browser, no CLI target. Requires polling a CDN snapshot, ~5s. AppSail WebSockets exist but cost ~$13/mo minimum and can never be free. | `onSnapshot`, sub-second, billed per document delivered on change. | product audit |
| 8 | Durable text fidelity | `varchar` silently clamps at 255; `text` caps at 10,000; **emoji and 4-byte UTF-8 are silently stored as `?`**. Requires a sanitiser on every durable write. | Full UTF-8, 1 MiB per document. | product audit |
| 9 | Sharing code across deploy units | Each function directory deploys independently, so `functions/_lib` must be vendored per directory at package time, with a drift guard and import-depth rewriting. | One deployable. | build |
| 10 | Spending safety | Transparent per-operation pricing with a $5/project floor. Cannot run away. | **No spending cap by default** on Blaze. Requires a manually-set budget alert, which `firebase-tools` cannot create — Cloud Billing budgets are console-only. | build |

## Severity trend worth noting

Three separate defects came from the single fact that `is_unique` is table-global, and the
failure mode got **quieter** each time:

1. `seq` allocated per-project against a global column → **deadlock**. Loud, immediate.
2. `unique(task_id)` → **cross-tenant denial of service**. Visible, but only to the victim.
3. `unique(idempotency_key)` on a client-supplied key → **silent cross-tenant event loss**.
   HTTP 200, a plausible `seq`, the event never written.

A platform property that produces progressively quieter failures is more dangerous than one
that fails loudly, because the third only surfaces as "the agent never saw the contract" weeks
later. This is the argument for probing every assumption rather than reading it.

## Method note

The dry-run double — replaying the real store's semantics in-process, including the *measured*
non-monotonic `ROWID` behaviour rather than the assumed one — caught entry 5, which no amount
of code reading would have found. It also refuses to answer an unrecognised ZCQL statement
rather than returning `[]`, so a typo cannot read as "no rows".

Recommended to both builds. It is cheap and it front-loads discovery to before anything
touches a cloud.
